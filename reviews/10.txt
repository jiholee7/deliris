I got my tattoo done by Gabe. He was honest and guided me with my original design, so we discuss few changes. Great customer service, very professional and really nice studio. The studio is gorgeous. Would recommend this place 100%. Is bright and minimalist,  so it makes you feel welcome and calm. Gabe is really great, easy to talk to and an expert with fine lines tattoo. I'm very happy with my design, already received many compliments on how nice it turned out.
