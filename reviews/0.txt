Gibbs was super patient with me while I was making decisions on my design. He drew up exactly what I wanted and even when I wanted to change a few things last second, he was willing to do it with no hesitation. My tattoo exceeded my expectations. This tattoo is very important to me. This was something I have been thinking about for about 15 years. It is better than I ever dreamed. I did a large tattoo on my arm. I will be going back to do my other arm.
