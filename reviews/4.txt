Hector did my tattoo and it was quick and easy. My tattoo was rather small but they were helpful throughout the whole process. From the moment I walked in the door to just check them out, all the way to when I came in for my appointment. The staff is nice and friendly and explained everything in detail so it was super helpful! Definitely looking to stay with this spot to do future tattoos!
