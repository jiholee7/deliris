I had a wonderful experience from the consultation meeting to actually getting the tattoo. The studio has a great atmosphere and the artists are super talented. Gabe was amazing and did an awesome job in creating the piece I had in mind. Thank you for everything and for making this a great experience. I canâ€™t wait to be back soon!
