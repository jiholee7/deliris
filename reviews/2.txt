This place was beyond amazing, as soon as I walked in I was offered some coffee, water, etcâ€¦ and the customer service was truly above and beyond! Gabe was my artist and he did such an amazing job on the line work and was very professional from beginning to end. Recommend this place 500% Also, keep an eye out for their new name change soon to Deliris ! Will be coming here for the rest of my tattoos
